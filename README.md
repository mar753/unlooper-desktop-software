# unlooper-desktop-software

This source code is intended for use with the Unlooper v2 device. It is a desktop console program intended for Windows to control the unlooper's hardware and run automated tests (glitch attacks). Using the main.hex file (compiled with avr-gcc 4.3.3 from WinAVR 20100110) from unlooper-microcontroller repo you can directly program ATtiny2313 microcontroller, which is a heart of the device from unlooper-circuit-diagram repo. Xilinx CPLD source program you can find in unlooper-frequency-divider-glitch repo. Complete information and documentation (currently only in Polish) is available here https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4R8EDQrHOdiUXhEdDhwN3JZTjQ. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
